  heading: About The Science Seed™
  text: >+
    The Science Seed™ is a science enrichment program designed to develop a love
    of science that will last a lifetime. Children are natural scientists;
    curious and full of the desire to observe and explore.  Preschool and early
    elementary are the perfect times to start a lifelong love of science by
    introducing students to basic concepts.

intro:
  heading: What we offer
  text: >-
    The Science Seed™ teaches geology, chemistry, biology, physics, nature and
    nutrition in fun, interactive and age-appropriate ways.  Instead of offering
    sessions in topic themes, we aim for students to understand the breadth of
    science…science is big and broad!  Therefore, any time your child is
    enrolled in our classes, whether it is an after school program, through the
    County classes or during their regular preschool day, they will have a mix
    of science disciplines.  By experiencing a broad range of topics, we hope
    all children will learn that they love science!


    Does your child love a particular type of science?  Our themed camps will be perfect for them.  Our camp focus on one discipline for a week-long in-depth exploration!

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
