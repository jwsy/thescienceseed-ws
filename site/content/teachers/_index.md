      Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its
      wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that
      provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides
      habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

    text: >
      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.

    text: >
      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

      Ms. Allegra was not a fan of science until high school, when one teacher
      changed her outlook.  A new-found lover of science, she received her B.S.
      in Biology from Mary Washington College and M.S. in Coral Geochemistry
      from the University of Maryland. Throughout the years she has tutored in
      math and science, including SAT prep.  She also spent time teaching marine
      science to elementary students in the Florida Keys and as a Teaching
      Assistant to undergrads in Environmental Geology at UMD.  While teaching
      at UMD, she won several teaching awards, including the Distinguished
      Teaching Award in 2001.  The first decade of her career she has been
      involved in marine and environmental research at the Smithsonian
      Institution’s Marine Systems Lab and Paleobiology Department.


      In 2004, Ms. Allegra took a break from research to stay home with her daughter, who was followed by a baby sister in 2005.  When her eldest daughter entered preschool in 2007, she wanted her to have a positive first experience to start her love of science early.  Ms. Allegra started teaching science to her daughter’s preschool class and the birth of The Science Seed™ concept began.

      Ms. Vesta has been teaching children from preschool to middle school since
      1996.  She received her BS in Elementary/Early Childhood at Kutztown
      University in Kutztown, Pa. While attending Kutztown University, she
      played field hockey and volunteered at a juvenile detention center. She
      enjoyed helping children and decided to become a teacher. After
      graduating, she moved to Virginia to live closer to her family and to
      start teaching. Her first job was a first grade teacher in Prince George’s
      County, MD.   In 2000, Ms. Vesta moved to Maryland and starting teaching
      in Virginia. That’s where her love for teaching science began. She became
      the Visiting Science Teacher for three schools in Alexandria City Public
      Schools. She taught students from preschool through sixth grade hands-on
      science experiments using the scientific method.  She also loves to spend
      time with her nieces and nephews from Pennsylvania and Texas and has
      enjoyed teaching for The Science Seed for several years. (Teaching with
      The Science Seed since 2013)
